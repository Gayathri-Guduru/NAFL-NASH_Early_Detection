# NAFL-NASH_Early_Detection
A gene expression analysis pipeline using the GSE182060 dataset for early detection and treatment of Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), focusing on differential expression, pathway enrichment, and biomarker discovery.

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive gene expression analysis pipeline for the GSE182060 dataset, focusing on identifying key genes and pathways involved in the early detection and treatment of Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). By conducting differential expression analysis, pathway enrichment, and generating visualizations (heatmaps and volcano plots), the project aims to uncover biomarkers and molecular pathways essential for diagnosing and treating these liver diseases at early stages.

## Key Features
- **Differential Expression Analysis**: Identifies genes significantly upregulated or downregulated between Baseline and Follow-up conditions.
- **KEGG Pathway Enrichment**: Highlights key pathways altered in NAFL and NASH progression.
- **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)**: Provides insights into the biological processes and molecular functions enriched in differentially expressed genes.
- **Visualizations**: Volcano plot and heatmap display the results to facilitate biomarker discovery and interpretation of gene expression patterns.

## Tools and Dependencies
To reproduce the analysis, you will need the following R packages:

- **GEOquery**: To retrieve and manage data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
- **limma**: For differential expression analysis.
- **clusterProfiler**: To perform KEGG pathway enrichment and GO analysis.
- **org.Hs.eg.db**: For mapping human gene identifiers.
- **KEGGREST**: To fetch KEGG pathway data.
- **msigdbr**: For accessing the Molecular Signatures Database.
- **ggplot2**: For generating visualizations such as volcano plots.
- **pheatmap**: To generate heatmaps of gene expression data.

## Installation
To install the necessary packages, run the following commands in your R environment:
```
# Install BiocManager if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")

## Results Interpretation
1. **Volcano Plot (Detection of Differential Expression)**
- **X-axis (Log Fold Change)**: Indicates the magnitude of gene expression changes between Baseline (healthy) and Follow-up (diseased or treated).
- **Positive logFC values**: Genes upregulated in Follow-up, potentially involved in disease progression or inflammation.
- **Negative logFC values**: Genes downregulated in Follow-up, possibly reflecting suppressed biological functions in NASH or NAFL.
- **Y-axis (-log10 Adjusted P-value)**: Indicates statistical significance.
- Genes with large fold changes and significant p-values are key candidates for understanding disease progression.
- **Interpretation**: Genes with significant differential expression are potential biomarkers for early detection of NAFL/NASH and could also help monitor treatment responses. Immune-related genes may indicate inflammatory processes in liver disease.

2. **Heatmap (Visualization of Differentially Expressed Genes)**
- **Red regions**: Genes upregulated in patients.
- **Blue regions**: Genes downregulated.

## Key Genes Identified:
- **CXCL10**: Involved in immune response and inflammation, often upregulated in inflammatory conditions like NASH.
- **CCL5**: Linked to inflammation and fibrosis, a key marker of liver disease progression.
- **CXCL9**, **CCL2**, **CCL3**: Additional immune-related genes crucial in the inflammatory process of NAFL/NASH.
- **Interpretation**: The clustering of patients and genes in the heatmap reveals patterns of gene regulation, which can pinpoint early-stage liver changes or therapeutic responses.

3. **KEGG Pathway and GO Biological Process Enrichment Results**
- **KEGG Pathway Enrichment**: Highlights pathways like cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and metabolic pathways. Disruption in these pathways plays a critical role in NAFL and NASH progression.
- **GO Biological Process Enrichment**: Highlights processes like inflammation, immune cell activation, and lipid metabolism, reflecting abnormal fat accumulation in the liver, a hallmark of NAFLD.
- **Interpretation:** Enrichment analyses help connect differentially expressed genes to relevant biological processes and pathways, identifying potential biomarkers for early detection of inflammation and liver dysfunction.

## Early Detection and Treatment Implications
- **Biomarkers for Early Detection**: Genes involved in inflammation and lipid metabolism, such as CXCL10 and CCL5, could serve as blood-based biomarkers for detecting early liver changes before fibrosis or cirrhosis occurs.
- **Treatment Response**: Monitoring the expression of genes like TRAF6 (involved in the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway) could help track the efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatments for liver disease.

## Conclusion
This project presents a detailed molecular landscape of NAFL and NASH, highlighting candidate biomarkers for early detection and potential therapeutic targets. The analysis focuses on immune-related genes, inflammatory markers, and pathways involved in liver metabolism, aligning with the goal of developing non-invasive alternatives for diagnosing liver diseases.
